/**
 * Converts exceptions into form errors.
 *
 * An exception handler gets passed the exception (or catchable error) that occurred during mapping the form to some
 * data, the form and the underlying data. Its responsibility is to extract some useful information for the user out
 * of the passed arguments and based on it create a FormError instance that will be attached to the form by the data
 * mapping layer.
 *
 * An exception layer can abstain from converting an exception (e.g. because it is a specialized implementation for
 * particular exceptions) and let other handlers deal with it by returning null.
