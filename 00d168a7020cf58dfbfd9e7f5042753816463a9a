While looking into #82 I realised that there is a good use case where you only need a `read_property_path`: value objects where there is no `write_property_path`

see #89 for the PR fixing support for read property paths with value objects

why is this a standalone PR? only removing the validation is enough to enable the feature or is this coupled to #89 and should only be part of that?
